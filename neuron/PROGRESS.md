# Neuron — Progress

Tracks implementation progress against `PLAN.md`. Updated per phase.

---

## Phase 0 — Foundation & local dev environment — ✅ built

Project skeleton under `neuron/` (separate from Synapse's tree); the shared
`neuron_core` library (typed `SynapseAdminClient`, `pydantic-settings` config
with `SecretStr` token, stdlib JSON/console logging, error types); unit tests
(httpx `MockTransport`) + an auto-skipping integration smoke test; a Docker
Compose dev stack (stock Synapse + PostgreSQL + Redis); CI (ruff + mypy +
pytest, path-filtered to `neuron/**`); dev-setup script.

Verified locally: ruff clean, mypy clean, unit tests pass. Live `docker compose`
bring-up needs a Docker daemon (run it in your environment to fully close it).

---

## Phase 1 — neuron-console (read-only) — ✅ built

A FastAPI web UI over the Synapse Admin API: operator login (password + signed
session cookie; the admin token stays server-side and never reaches the
browser), and server-rendered pages for the dashboard, users (list/search/
detail), rooms (list/search/detail), content reports, and `/healthz`.

---

## Phase 2 — neuron-console (write) + auth-mode handling — ✅ built

Write actions: create/modify/deactivate users, reset password (classic auth),
shadow-ban, registration tokens, server notices, room block/delete (async +
status page), redaction (async + status page). CSRF protection on every form,
confirmation prompts for destructive actions, flash messages. Under
`NEURON_AUTH_MODE=mas`, endpoints Synapse disables are blocked with a clear
message (full MAS/OIDC operator login deferred per the classic-first decision).

---

## Phase 3 — neuron-supervisor (plaintext moderation) — ✅ built

A privileged bot that promotes itself to room admin (Admin API
`make_room_admin`) and moderates: kick/ban as the bot (new `MatrixClient`,
Client-Server API), redact a user's messages (Admin API). A console Supervision
tab drives promote-all and per-room promote + per-member Kick/Ban. CLI:
`python -m neuron_supervisor sync|run`.

---

## Phase 4 — neuron-auditor (plaintext) — ✅ built, awaiting review gate

**Goal:** stream events from unencrypted rooms to durable outputs.

**Scope note:** plaintext only. The plan named matrix-nio for the bot; since
matrix-nio's value is E2EE (deferred to Phase 5), the plaintext auditor uses our
own lightweight `/sync` client (`MatrixClient`) — fewer dependencies, fully
testable. matrix-nio / decryption arrives in Phase 5.

### Delivered
- **`neuron_core` MatrixClient:** added `sync` (long-poll `/sync` with `since`),
  `join_room`, and `messages` (history pagination).
- **`neuron_auditor` package:**
  - `Auditor` — `poll_once()` (sync → auto-join invites → record timeline events
    → persist token) and `run_forever()` (resilient loop). Token persistence
    (`state.py`) gives **no gaps and no duplicates across restarts**.
  - Sinks (`sinks.py`): `FileSink` (JSON Lines), `S3Sink` (one object per event,
    S3/MinIO), `CompositeSink` ("both"), and `build_audit_record` — a **stable
    JSON envelope** (room/event/type/sender/ts/content + `encrypted`/`decrypted`
    flags). Encrypted events are **recorded as undecryptable envelopes, not
    dropped**.
  - `AuditorSettings` (bot token, sink choice, file path, S3 config, state path).
  - `python -m neuron_auditor run|once` CLI.
- **Config:** `auditor` extra (boto3 for S3); `NEURON_AUDITOR_*` settings.
  `.gitignore` excludes the state file and local audit log.

### Verified locally
- `ruff` clean, `mypy` clean (24 source files), `pytest` → **43 passed,
  3 skipped**. New tests: `sync`/`join_room`, the record schema (incl. encrypted),
  `FileSink` JSONL, `S3Sink` (fake client → correct bucket/key/body), and the
  `Auditor` loop (records + token persisted; restart resumes from token;
  auto-join invites; encrypted event recorded not dropped). CLI runs.

### Phase 4 acceptance criteria status
- [✅] Events appear as JSON in the filesystem sink and S3, no gaps across a
  restart — covered by unit tests (file/S3 sinks + token-resume); ready for a
  live run (`run` against the dev Synapse + MinIO).

### Review gate
Run the auditor against the dev Synapse, send messages in a room the bot is in,
and confirm they land in `audit-log.jsonl` (and MinIO if configured), surviving a
restart. When happy, we proceed to **Phase 5 — E2EE for auditor & supervisor**
(the hard phase).
